# TicTacToe-Console-Game

## Intro
This game was an assignemt wherewe had to use java to create an object oriented tic tac toe game using classes. The bonus for the assignment was to add in ai to attack and defend against opponents. I ended up finishing the assingment early and decided to also create a Gui version of the game where you click buttons instead of inputing the location of the move.

## How it works 
There are two game modes


# # How to run
must be in the folder in terminal
### 1. compile all the code
```bash
javac *.java
```

```
